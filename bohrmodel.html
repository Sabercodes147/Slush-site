        <h3>This is the Bohr model page</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">In the bohr model there are three rings. These have different amount of electrons. The first ring CAN only have two electrons.<br>
            The second and so on can have eight electrons.<br>
            If you don't know what electrons are I will tell you. The atom is the smallest unit. A electron is a subatomic particle.<br>
            They give off negative charge. They have no smaller particles.<br>
            In the middle of an atome there is an nucleus with protons and neutrons.<br>
            Protons have a positive charge. Neutrons have no charge at all.<br>
            The number of protons and electrons are the same. 
        </p><br>

        <p style="color: white;" >Ready for your mind to be blown.<br>
           The subatomic particles I talked about have even smaller particles; the nuetrons and the protons have quarks in them.<br>
           A proton is made up of of two up quarks and one down quark.<br>
           A nuetron is made up of two down quarks and one up quark.<br>
           There are many different quarks but not that many; there is the up quark, down quark, top quark, bottom quark, charm quark and starnge quark.<br>
           What's that I hear "what about an electron what quarks is it made of!"<br>
           Well an electron is a elementary particles meaning they can't be made of smaller particles.<br>
           I hope you had a fun time reading all of these.</p><br>
